# Incident-Handler-s-Journal
In this project, I described my experience doing a thorough analysis on a health care organization that was attacked by an Unethical hacker. My goal is to provide detailed notes using the 5 W's of an incident (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) and explain recommendations for how this incident could of been prevented.
